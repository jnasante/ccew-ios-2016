Introduction to Swift
================================

As we know, Objective-C is Apple's language built on top of the C language. We can see that in the way we write it, from memory management to pointers, to the much of the syntax in general. It of course has some key differences such as its bracket notation, storyboarding, and key-value coding. This language, while powerful, has typically been difficult to learn and to use, because it looks wildy different from any other language (syntactically) and, of course, is complex and can be difficult to read.

Swift was introduced with iOS 8, as Apple's new programming language. According to Apple, it is an easy transition for those familiar with Objective-C coding standards, and is easy to learn for those just beginning iOS programming. Now in version 3, Swift is light years ahead of Objective-C when it comes to the programming experience. While keeping many of the characteristics that we've come to know and love (descriptive names, Automatic Reference Counting, dynamic typing, and more), it has eliminated much of the complexity we saw in Objective-C.
