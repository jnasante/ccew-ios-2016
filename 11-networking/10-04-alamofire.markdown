Alamofire
====================================

Alamofire is the Swift version of AFNetworking. If you haven't noticed already, the "AF" in AFNetworking  stands for Alamo Fire.

Alamofire works much like AFNetworking in that it is a massive library built to handle networking code in your application. The documentation and API for Alamofire is excellent, so rather than explain it myself, I'll direct you to their github page. Once you understand the concepts in the previous sections about HTTP protocols, you'll be able to easily transition to using any library such as Alamofire.

## Install and read about Alamofire 

Download Alamofire from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire).

It's generally better to use the first method with cocoa pods and carthage, as it allows you to keep up with updates as easily as typing "carthage update" in the command line. Otherwise, manual installation is still relatively simple.

*Happy networking!*
