##Debug Assignment 4

We're creating an array of strings in our `viewDidLoad:` method and then iterating through the list and printing the number of digits in each string. But our application is crashing right away. Why?

Hint: Set an exception breakpoint to find out exactly when the application is crashing and examine the variables in the debugger. Something isn't quite what you'd expect.
